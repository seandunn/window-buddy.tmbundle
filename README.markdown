Window Buddy
============

Window Buddy is a bundle to add basic window management to TextMate

Sorry but... WORK IN PROGRESS!

Currently it's a bit rough and incomplete but the aim is to provide pseudo split window editing by using auxiliary windows in TextMate.

---

Installation
============

Window Buddy depends on the TMTools plugin and the rb-appscript gem.
If you're using the RubyAMP gem then the chances are you already have both installed already.

TMTools
-------

You can download TMTools from the [TMTools Site](http://email.eva.mpg.de/~bibiko/downloads/textmate/TMTools.tmplugin.zip)

You can get more [information about TMTools here](http://email.eva.mpg.de/~bibiko/downloads/textmate/tmtoolshelp.html)

rb-appscript
------------
    gem install rb-appscript
    
---

Todo list
=========
*   Project completion from aux windows
*   Automate the Reveal in Project step
*   Tweak loads of stuff...

Heroes!
=======

This bundle is really simple but it's based on the work of several others who really deserve the credit.

Firstly, Allan Odgaard and the TextMate team obviously; TextMate rocks.
Hans-JÃ¶rg Bibiko for the TMTools plugin.

Hamish Sanderson for his [rb-appscript gem](http://appscript.sourceforge.net/rb-appscript/index.html)
Matt Neuburg for his book [Scripting Mac Applications With Ruby: An AppleScript Alternative](http://www.apeth.com/rbappscript/00intro.html)
