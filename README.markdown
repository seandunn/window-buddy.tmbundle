Window Buddy
============

Window Buddy is a bundle to add basic window management to TextMate

Sorry but... WORK IN PROGRESS!

Currently it's a bit rough and incomplete but the aim is to provide pseudo split window editing by using auxiliary windows in TextMate.

Installation
============

Window Buddy depends on the TMTools plugin and the rb-appscript gem.
If you're using the RubyAMP gem then the chances are you already have both installed already.
